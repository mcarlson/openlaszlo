<h2>LPS Help: Application Viewer</h2>

<p>The Application Viewer displays a Laszlo application in an HTML
page together with commonly used development features.  <a
href="#tasks"><b>Tasks</b></a> contains links that operate on the
application.  </p><a href="#tasks"><b>Resources</b></a> contains links
to additional development resources.</p>

<a name="tasks"><h3>Tasks</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="debug"/>Debug
<dd>Reload the application with the <b>debug</b> flag set.  This is equivalent to adding a <code>debug="true"</code> attribute to the application's <classname>canvas</classname> element, except that it doesn't require editing the application's source.  With the <b>debug</b> flag, the debugger window is shown within the application, and additional tests for program errors are performed during application execution.
</dd>

<dt><a name="wrapper"/>HTML wrapper
<dd>View the HTML wrapper for the application.  The HTML in this page can be copied into the page that will contain the application during deployment.
</dd>

<dt><a name="reload"/>Reload
<dd>Reload the application.  If any application sources have changed since the application was compiled, recompile it.
</dd>

<dt><a name="source"/>View source
<dd>Display the text of the application source file in a browser window.
</dd>

<dt><a name="optimize"/>Optimize
<dd>Create a version of the application that starts up quickly.  Clicking
on this link will display the within a browser window, and then create an
optimized version of the application and display a link to display it.
</dd>
