<p>Window panel is a fixed-size window. It is also the basis for "window" (which
  is resizable), "modal dialog", and "alert". The base art for "window panel" is
  constructed of 9 pieces. 4 corners, 4 resizable middle edges and the middle.
  There are also controls included: the gripper (and title) and close button
  (with 4 states). </p>
<p>The window panel has 3 states: deselected (_dslct), selected (_slct) and dragging
  (_drag). The background of the deselected state has less contrast and no shadow.
  The selected state has more contrast and a small perimeter shadow. Dragging
  the window creates a more pronounced shadow, adding to the illusion that the
  window has been brought to front and is above other UI objects. Drag state
  only applies to resources on the right and bottom sides, the top and left use
  the same resources as the selected state.</p>
