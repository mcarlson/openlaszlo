<h2>Focus </h2>

<p>Focus is the visual component of keyboard navigation. Keyboard navigation
  allows the components to be used without a mouse. The tab key activates focus
  and moves between components in an application, the arrow keys enable selection
  within a component and the enter key or spacebar activates the selection. Focus
  appears as four brackets which adjust their dimension to surround the selected
  component. The brackets animate between objects as the tab key is pressed and
  disappears after a few seconds. Focus is enabled by default and has automatic
  awareness of included components and their position within an application. </p>
<p>Focus is defined by eight pieces:</p>
<p>1-4. The corner brackets</p>
<p>5-8. Shadows of the corner brackets</p>
<p>The bracket edges are two pixels thick (light and dark rows), enabling contrast
  against most background colors. Small drop shadows give the illusion that the
  brackets are floating slightly above the selected component. Focus has only
  one state, and can be disabled. </p>
