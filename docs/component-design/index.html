<h2><a name="overview"></a>Components Overview</h2>
<p>OpenLaszlo Components (LZ Components) are a core set of customizable user interface
  devices included with the OpenLaszlo Server.</p>
<p>LZ Components are written in the OpenLaszlo language (LZX) and designed to facilitate
  the construction of LZX applications. The set (illustrated on the following
  page) mimics the rich behavior of operating system and client software interface
  elements. </p>
<p><strong>Component features</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple states (up, mouse-over, down and disabled)</li>
  <li>Colorization </li>
  <li>Custom font</li>
  <li>Customizable spacing</li>
  <li>Layout options</li>
  <li>Keyboard navigation</li>
  <li>Automatic sizing based on content</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Using Components</strong></p>
<p>Components can be used in their default form, or may be modified to adapt
  to the design of the applications that include them. This document covers several
  levels of modification:</p>
<p><strong>Colorization</strong></p>
<p>The simplest method of modifying components is to change the "style". </p>
<p>Style is a palette which defines a family of colors for the component set.
  There are 6 styles included with the OpenLaszlo platform. New styles can easily be included
  by modifying existing values.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying Attributes</strong></p>
<p>Each component has a set of adjustable parameters called "attributes".
  Attributes are contained in the component code and surface common controls
  for adjusting values such as width, height, color, and positioning. Information
  about the attributes of each component are located in the LZX documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Replacing Visual Resources (Skinning)</strong></p>
<p>Visual transformation of the components is possible by replacing resources
  (skinning). Knowledge of component construction, details of assembly and production
  methods are necessary to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>OpenLaszlo Components Set</strong></p>
<p>These are examples of the components included with OpenLaszlo Server:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/image003.png" width="337" height="480"></p>
    <p><img src="images/image006.png" width="397" height="492"></p>
    <p><img src="images/image009.png" width="316" height="238"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="colorization"></a>Colorization</h3>
<p>The color of the components can be globally modified by changing the style.
  Style is referenced by the application utilizing the component set and automatically
  affects any component included. There are six styles included in the OpenLaszlo
  component set. The default style is "white". </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/image012.png" width="337" height="490"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>The set of attributes in a style specify the color values for different parts
  of a component. These colors can be adjusted independently and automatically
  affect the component set globally. Each of the style attributes below (except "Border
  Size") is defined by a hexadecimal color value. Most of the colors used
  directly reflect the specified color. The "Base Color" attribute
  is the main tint applied across components. This value adds color to the resources
  that have been created in grayscale. This colorization will affect resources
  differently based on their original value. Some experimentation may be necessary
  to find a tinting color that produces the desired colorization. </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/image015.png" width="382" height="276"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Style Attributes in Code</h3>
<p>The styles are defined in the file "defaultstyles.lzx" which
  is located in the "base" directory (more on file locations in
  the "Component Files" on page 5). The code is fairly simple to
  evaluate and uses names for color values which are defined in the component
  color palette. An overview of the code for style is in the LZX reference.</p>
<h3>Color Palette</h3>
<p>It is helpful to create a color palette when building new styles. A palette
  is a simple library where hexadecimal values are given names. It is useful
  to experiment and choose multiple colors before creating a palette.</p>
<p>These are the colors defined in LZX and LZ Components. They can be referred
  to by name in LZX code. Component colors are in the "colors.lzx" located
  in the "base" directory. </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/image018.png" width="368" height="456"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="modifying"></a>Modifying Attributes</h3>
<p>Beyond the global adjustments achieved through styles, each component also
  has its own distinct attributes. While it is not necessary for a designer to
  program in LZX, understanding the basic syntax and an awareness of existing
  attributes expedites modification of the component set. The attributes of each
  component are listed in the LZX Reference.</p>
<p>A component is defined in code by a "view" or "tag".
  Using the tag &lt;window/&gt;, for example, will add a window to an application.
  Window has a content and title area (with gripper) by default. The example
  below also has a title defined and enabled close and resize buttons.</p>
<p><img src="images/image019.png" width="284" height="123"></p>
<p>Attributes are used to describe and modify a particular instance of a component.
  When the attributes are accessed through the tag, that instance is modified.
  In the example below, the attribute for color is changed, the title has been
  revised, the offset for the content area has been increased, resize widget
  has been removed and buttons (with their own attributes) have been included.</p>
<p><img src="images/image020.png" width="281" height="118"></p>
<p>This is only one of many possible ways to modify this particular component.
  Familiarity with attributes makes minor customization painless and expands
  the potential for creative solutions.</p>

<p>Components are designed to work together to form more complex structures.
  It is easy to add a scrolling list and a menu to a window simply by nesting
  the subordinate component tags in the window. The example below is constructed
  using only default components.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/image023.png" width="323" height="239"></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This flexibility and the ease of changing the values of attributes simplifies
  the modification of the default look for designers and developers.</p>
<h3><a name="skinning"></a>Replacing Visual Resources (Skinning)</h3>
<p>The look of a component can be significantly altered to correspond with the
  design of an application by changing resources. This is achieved most easily
  by replacing the default resources with custom resources of the same size,
  file name and format. Resources which are replaced, but contain the same name
  will automatically be updated when the application is refreshed. Alterations
  using sizes or file types different from the default set is possible, but will
  require a deeper understanding of construction methods. The Component Construction
  section of this document provides descriptions of how each is assembled, the
  file names, and states. If designs for an application involve a look + feel
  or interactivity beyond the scope of the default component set, the LZ and/or
  Base components will need to be modified.</p>
<h3>Component Files</h3>
<p>Component files are located in the LPS directory. The path to the "Components" directory
  is: $LPS_HOME/lps/components/... The OpenLaszlo component set is comprised
  of four categories of files:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Base Components</strong></p>
<p>LZ Components extend one or more base components. These provide the underlying
  logic for the set and contain no visual resources. For the most part, designers
  will not need to manipulate these files.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LZ Components</strong></p>
<p>LZ Components define the class for the UI device. These files utilize visual
  resources and define attributes of the component. These are the LZX files which
  will most likely be modified by designers. They generally contain resource
  inclusions and attributes at the top of the code and are relatively easy to
  understand and manipulate.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LZ Resources</strong></p>
<p>Resources are the visual assets that make up the look (skin) of a component.
  Resources may be a variety of file types, depending on the behaviors of the
  objects, the desired effect, or look. The resources are often pieces used to
  create whole components and their respective states. Visual reference for resources
  are covered in the "Component Construction" section. The default color of the resources is gray, which is used to provide
  a neutral palette for colorizing. There are some visual elements in the components
  that are not external file resources. The LZX language is capable of building
  primitive shapes (rectangles) and these are used where possible within components.
  Often these shapes are more efficient to use than a resource as they decrease
  load time of an application and increase performance. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A collection of various True Type Format (ttf) fonts are included with the OpenLaszlo platform.
 The default fonts used in components are the outline font Bitstream "Vera" and
  the Ultra Pixel Font "Verity". The outline font can be used at
  any point size, but is not recommended for sizes smaller than 12 point due
  to poor rendering quality of the Flash player. To circumvent this problem,
  the Verity is used for smaller instances. Ultra Pixel Fonts, unlike other bitmap
  fonts, forces anti-aliasing which creates smooth, legible characters. Verity
  is included in 9 and 11 point sizes with roman, italic, bold and bold italic
  styles. This font is designed to mimic the look of Bitstream Vera and can,
  therefore, be used seamlessly in conjunction with the outline version. Bitmap
  (or Pixel) fonts such as "Verity" will only render correctly
  when specified at 8pt. The Verity ttf file (9 or 11) must be used to change
  size. The default font Verity contains an unaccented subset of characters.
  For the full Windows Western Unicode font set, use VerityPlus, which includes
  accented European characters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Bitstream font Vera was released as an open source font for the Gnome
  Project. The Ultra Pixel font Verity was built by Christopher Lowery using
  technology produced by Truth in Design. </p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Creating Resources (Tips + Tricks)</h3>
<p>Creating your own resources to modify the look of a component requires an
  understanding of not only the construction, but also of the characteristics
  of file types and the manner in which LZX utilizes them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Component File Types</strong></p>
<p>Although LZX supports multiple graphic formats, The default resources for
  components are almost entirely .swf files. There a few instances where .pngs
  have been used for specific reasons (documented in Component Construction).
  The primary reason for using .swf files is that they are vector-based, and
  therefore resolution independent. This independence allows files to be resized
  or stretched without degrading. .Swf files are the only vector file type supported
  by OpenLaszlo. Although the obvious tool for creating ..swf files is Macromedia
  Flash, many vector-based applications, such as Adobe Illustrator allow export
  of files to this format. If the option is given, .swf files should always be
  saved as version 5.0. The exporter for Illustrator 10 does not provide an option,
  but uses 5.0 by default.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Working with Vector Art</strong></p>
<p>There are some obstacles to overcome when creating vector art for export.
  A sometimes useful but quirky effect is that, unlike bitmaps, vector shapes
  can use fractions of pixels as values for placement and dimension. This can
  cause problems when the shape is exported and used in LZX. The shape will anti-alias
  to compensate for the non-integer value and effectively change the dimension
  of the resource. There are a handful of instances where this can be beneficial,
  but most often it will cause annoying alignment issues. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Working on a Grid</strong></p>
<p>There are several methods to ensure integer pixel values. Regardless of the
  vector-based application being used, it is crucial to set the unit of measure
  to pixels (or points, as they are equivalent). This includes creating a pixel
  grid and using the "snap to grid" feature. It is also helpful
  to control dimension and position objects numerically, as this will lower the
  possibility of fractional values. These procedures predominantly apply to rectilinear
  objects. Circles and angles will anti-alias by nature, however, by aligning
  points on pixel boundaries more predictable anti-aliasing will be experienced.
  There are also instances (such as in Macromedia Flash) where the position of
  an object on the page or stage will be translated into the resulting file.
  Unless an offset is part of the desired effect, make sure that objects are "zeroed
  out" (x=0, y=0).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<p>Many of the resource files employ transparency. This allows the object to
  be placed on, and anti-alias to any background. This is an automatic feature
  of .swf files. Unless a background is created or specified, areas around the
  object are automatically transparent. In "multi-frame" resources
  (those with multiple states), transparency is used to ensure alignment of resources
  with different dimensions. The disabled state of most components is an example
  of this. Resources for this state are smaller than the enabled states, but
  are aligned because they incorporate a transparent rectangle with dimensions
  equal to the enabled resource.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Preparing Resources</strong> </p>
<p>To create the multiple resources that are used to build the majority of the
  components it is useful to first build the object as a whole and then slice
  it. Some vector-based applications (including Adobe Illustrator) have the ability
  to "slice to guides" this is intended to be used in the production
  of multi-part resources, but does not work reliably. A superior, but less-automated
  method is to cut along the grid or guides with the "knife" tool.
  This is handy because it allows cutting through multiple (unlocked) layers.
  To guarantee a straight cut along pixel boundaries set your document&Otilde;s
  magnification to increments of 100 (200%, 1600% etc) and hold shift key to
  force a straight line. With the resource cut into appropriate pieces, it is
  then necessary to move each resource individually to a separate document and
  export to ..swf. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Objects with solid fills can be easily cut and exported from any vector-based
  application. Objects with strokes will not be correctly rendered in LZX and
  should be converted to outline shapes (Strokes created in Macromedia Flash
  are an exception). If the object to be cut has a gradient fill, many applications
  will not cut the fill correctly. For objects with gradient fills it is preferable
  to export the object whole, import it into Flash for cutting. Flash effectively "flattens" the
  resource and will not repeat the gradation in each piece. When importing vector
  files into Flash, it is best to already have them in the .swf format. Cutting
  and pasting or importing Illustrator files into Flash has a tendency to drop
  pieces, botch bezier curves, incorrectly translate color or entirely deny the
  import.</p>
