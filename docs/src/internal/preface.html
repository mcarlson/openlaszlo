<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>We invented this technology to make it possible to create web
applications that are delightful to use.</p>

<p>Every computer user knows the power of the Internet, and every web
surfer has been awed at one time or another by the vast wealth of the
Web. But at the same time everyone knows, even if they only know it
subconsciously, that web-based applications running in a browser offer
a user experience that is inherently inferior to that of
locally-running programs. There is something almost retrograde about
interacting with websites; they're anomalous, like rotary telephones
in a touch-tone world.</p>

<p>The reason for this is clear. It's not because web designers don't
know anything about usability or visual design or software
engineering. It's because they have not had the tools they require to
build the web experience they conceive.</p>

<p>HTML is a great thing; DHTML is a great thing. Macromedia's
Flash<d:trademark/> is a great thing. But none of them allow
developers to create astounding user experiences, because all of them
are based on fundamentally limited models. The variants of HTML are
based on the metaphor of a &quot;page,&quot; which forces users to
process information in arbitrary discrete chunks separated by jarring
transitions and &quot;page refreshes.&quot; Flash offers the
possibility of a much more continuous user experience, but its
&quot;movie&quot; metaphor forces developers to leave behind many
essential tools and techniques of modern software development.</p>

<p>In contrast, Laszlo's solution was built from the ground up for
application development &#x2014; not &quot;page&quot; development, not
&quot;movie&quot; development &#x2014; and is centered around standard
development approaches. LZX applications are written in XML files with
embedded JavaScript, which provides an ideal foundation for teams of
serious developers. Laszlo supports standards-based object-oriented
development and data binding, and enables rich interactivity without
requiring complex, timeline-based visual authoring.</p>

<p>The result is applications that are delightful to use. Now,
delightfulness is in the eye of the beholder, of course, and that's
why we suggest that you right now click on  our <a href="/demos/amazon/amazon.lzx">e-commerce</a>
application.
 This program communicates with
Amazon.com's data servers and allows you to browse their products,
create a wish list, fill a shopping cart, and so forth. So in many
ways it's just like any other similar e-commerce site. But notice that
there are no screen refreshes, and that you can move items by dragging
them with the mouse, that it's hard to get &quot;lost.&quot; Now
consider that this program was written in a few hours using a simple
text editor.</p>

<p>We suggest that you play around with any of the dozens of other
sample applications <a href="/demos/">here</a> or on the Laszlo Systems <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/demos/">website</a>   to get a feel for
what a Laszlo application is like. One sometimes hears the phrase
&quot;Rich Internet Application&quot; to describe programs like these,
and their defining characteristic is that they make people smile. A
growing body of empirical studies <todo>source</todo> shows that when
people have a more pleasant experience on a website, the longer they
stay there, and on commercial sites, the more commerce they
transact.</p>

<h2>Audience and rationale for this book</h2>

<p>This book is written for software developers who have familiarity
with the concepts of object-oriented programming as implemented in
languages such as Java, C++, or JavaScript, and with the fundamentals
of XML data formats.</p>

<p>We also hope that this <i>Guide</i> will be accessible to web
developers who know HTML and CSS but haven't yet worked with object
oriented languages, and to developers and designers familiar with
Flash or FlashMX. If this describes you, you may have a little
homework to do outside the scope of this book, but in general you
should have no trouble becoming a fluent LZX developer. A good place
for you to start learning would be with the <a
href="${tutorials}">tutorials</a>.</p>
<h3>Learn by Doing</h3>
<p>This Guide contains hundreds of "live" examples, that is, 
Laszlo Applications that are embedded in this page. You'll have more fun and get more out of this document if you "play with the code." To do so,
simply click on the "Edit" link at the bottom left corner of each example. This will cause a new window to pop up that is a self-contained
environment for modifying and executing Laszlo applications. Edit the sample code then click "update" and see the results displayed in the 
right-hand side of the window. To return the sample code to its inital state, click "Reset." </p>
<p>
If you would like to save a copy of the application for later use, click on the "Save As" button.
</p>



<h3>Sequential and Random Access</h3>

<p><i>Designing, Developing and Deploying Laszlo Applications</i> is intended for sequential and random
access. In general each chapter draws on the concepts covered in the chapters
that precede it, but not (too much) on those in the chapters that follow it. If you start with Chapter One
and read to the end, you won't get lost.</p>  
<p>
 At the same time each
chapter is designed to be encyclopedic: the chapter on Animation
covers the entire subject of animation, and so forth.</p>
<p> 
 Short self-contained examples appear throughout. Longer examples are linked to.</p>


<h2>Typographic Conventions</h2>
<p>Code is displayed thus: <code>var a = f(2)</code>.  Longer sections of code and other verbatim information is displayed in a separate paragraph:</p>

<pre>
An example file
that spans several
lines
</pre>

<p>Example programs are shown thus:</p>
<example executable="false">&lt;canvas height="20"&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;</example>

<p>Some example programs are run within the page.  The running
application is shown first, followed by the application source code,
followed by an Edit button that allows you to try out the effect of
making changes to the application source code.</p>
<example>&lt;canvas height="20"&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;</example>

<todo>Material marked thus is only shown in the beta distributions of
the documentation, and must be eliminated before the product is
final.</todo>

<fixme>Material in <d:sgmltag>fixme</d:sgmltag> is only shown
internally, and should not be present in beta or final
distributions.</fixme>

<h2>Suggested reading paths</h2>
<todo>
This section, ideally, may be replaced with an interactive (lzx) map.
</todo>

<p>The best way to use the <em>LZX Developer's Guide</em> depends on
your experience.</p>

<p><em>Experienced Object-Oriented programmers</em>: We suggest that
you start by reading Chapters 1, 2 and 4 of this Guide. If you have
never worked with JavaScript, you can learn the basics quickly at one
of the JavaScript tutorials at <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3Schools</a>, <a
href="http://www.wdvl.com/Authoring/JavaScript/Tutorial/">WVDL</a>, or
<a href="http://www.pageresource.com/jscript/">PageResource.com</a>. Then visit
the Laszlo Systems website and the Laszlo demo-hosting site <a
href="http://mylaszlo.com">MyLaszlo.com</a> and play around with the
tutorials and sample programs; as you read the sample code be sure to
look up appropriate entries in the <em>Reference Manual.</em> At that
point you'll know what further reading you need to do in this
guide.</p>
<p><em>Web/Flash developers with no Object-Oriented experience:</em>
We suggest that you start with the <a
href="${tutorials}">tutorials</a> in order to get a general feel for
LZX programming. Don't worry about mastering the subjects they cover;
your goal is to begin to get comfortable with the language.</p>

<p>If you need to, learn the basics of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>.</p>

<p>Then read the rest of <xref linkend="overview">Part
I of this guide</xref>.</p>

<todo>Work your way through a JavaScript tutorial
<todo>link</todo>. Caution: it makes sense to read the first four
chapters of this book before doing the JavaScript tutorial, because
LZX employs JavaScript in a way that is quite distinct from the way it
is used in web browsers.</todo>

<todo>Then read Chapters 4 through 12 of this manual, making sure that
you edit the sample programs.  After you've done that you'll be
an experienced Object Oriented programmer and able to decide for
yourself how best to proceed from there.</todo>

<h3>Use the Forums</h3>

<p>The best way to learn any programming language is to draw upon the
experience and goodwill of its development community (and to write
code! as the saying goes, nobody learned to ride a bicycle by reading
about it). The LZX developer community has a home at <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/forums/">http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/forums/</a>. There
you will find an active discussion of all aspects of the language, and
a place to ask questions of your own.</p>
