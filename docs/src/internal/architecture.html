<h1>Laszlo Architecture</h1>

<p>
 Laszlo Presentation Server, LPS, is a platform for rich Internet applications that are easy to develop and deploy. 
The Laszlo system architecture combines the power and usability of client/server design with the 
administrative advantages and cost effectiveness of web applications.
</p>

<p>        
LPS is a Java application that executes in a J2EE servlet
container. LPS may communicate with <glossterm>back end</glossterm>
servers and data sources using a variety of protocols. Laszlo
applications written in LZX are compiled by LPS and served as bytecode
to a plug in that runs in the client's web browser.  This constitutes
the <dfn>front end</dfn>.  The currently supported run-time
environment, the Flash 5 or higher plug-in, executes consistently and
reliably on a variety of operating systems and device types, including
Windows, Pocket PC, Mac OS, Linux, and Solaris, and a variety of
mobile and set-top box platforms. LPS outputs bytecode in the SWF file
format recognized by the Macromedia Flash player (version 5.0 and
higher). Nothing in the Laszlo architecture binds it to Flash,
however.  In the future, Laszlo may support other run time clients as
they become widely available.</p>

<p>
In the Laszlo context, <dfn>client</dfn> means LZX application executing in user's web browser, and <dfn>server</dfn> means
 LPS (which may, in turn, communicate with other servers).  The LZX client and LPS server communicate over HTTP; LPS sends byte code
 and the LZX application sends XML.</p>

<p>All Laszlo platform features, including streaming media and notification, are delivered over HTTP or HTTPS. Laszlo-based applications 
thus maintain compatibility with standard corporate firewalls. This is a critical capability for public Internet applications.</p>

<h2>Laszlo Server Architecture</h2>

<p>
The Laszlo Presentation Server executes within a standard J2EE application server or Java servlet container running JRE 1.3 or higher. 
These application server environments scale well, as does LPS itself. Laszlo applications can run on any OS 
supported by these server products. Laszlo supports Windows, Solaris, Linux and Mac OS X server environments.</p>

<p>The Laszlo Presentation Server consists of five main subsystems: </p>

<ul>
   <li>the <glossterm>Interface Compiler</glossterm></li>
   <li>the <glossterm>Media Transcoder</glossterm></li>
   <li>the <glossterm>Data Manager</glossterm></li>
   <li>the <glossterm>Persistent Connection Manager</glossterm></li>
   <li>the <glossterm>Cache</glossterm></li>
</ul>

<img class="illustration" src="images/architecture-2.gif"
     title="Laszlo Server Architecture"/>

<h3>The Interface Compiler</h3>

<p>The <glossterm>Interface Compiler</glossterm> consists of an
<glossterm>LZX Tag Compiler</glossterm>, and a <glossterm>Script
Compiler</glossterm>.  The Interface Compiler additionally invokes the
Media Compiler and the Data Manager to compile media and data sources
that are <glossterm>baked in</glossterm> to the application.</p>

<p>The LZX tag and script compilers convert Laszlo application
description tags and JavaScript into executable (swf) bytecode for
transmission to the Laszlo client environment. This code is placed into the cache, from which it is sent to the client. Depending on how
the application is invoked, it is transmitted either as a .swf file, or as an HTML file with an embedded .swf object.</p>

<p>        
The Media Transcoder converts a full range of media assets into a single format for rendering by Laszlo's target 
client rendering engine. This enables a Laszlo application to present supported media types in a unified manner on a 
single canvas, without the distraction of multiple helper applications or supplemental playback software.</p>

<p>The Media Transcoder automatically transcodes the following media
types: JPEG, GIF, PNG, MP3, TrueType, and SWF (art/animation
only).</p>

<h3>The Data Manager</h3>

<p>
The Data Manager is comprised of a data compiler that converts all data into a compressed binary format readable by Laszlo 
applications and a series of data connectors that enable Laszlo applications to retrieve data via XML/HTTP. Laszlo applications
 can thus interface across the network with databases, XML Web Services, and Web-server based files or executables.</p>

<h3>The Persistent Connection Manager</h3>

<p>        
The Persistent Connection Manager handles authentication and real-time messaging for Laszlo applications which require them. 
It provides real-time messaging and notification or data push over HTTP.</p>

<warning>This feature is provisional.  It works in limited capacity
situations and is fine to develop with, but we do not recommend
deployment (with the possible exception of low-capacity, non-mission
critical deployment) with this feature. Please consult Laszlo directly
if you have questions about the robustness of an application that uses
this version of the persistent connection.</warning>
<h3>The Cache</h3>
<p>The cache contains the most recently compiled version of any application. The first time a Laszlo application is 
requested, it is compiled and the resultant SWF file is sent to the client. A copy is also cached on the server, so that subsequent
requests do not require waiting for the compilation.</p>


<h2>Laszlo Client Architecture</h2>

<p>
Laszlo's client architecture consists of the Laszlo Foundation Classes, a core library compiled into every Laszlo application 
that provides run-time services (such as, for example, a timer and an idling function) and a presentation renderer to
 provide 2D graphics rendering and sound playback.  
 None of these classes rely on Flash services or use the Flash object model. The Flash 
player is used solely as a rendering engine.</p>

     title="Laszlo Client Architecture"/>


<example title="Empty Application" extract="false">&lt;canvas/&gt;</example>

<p>        
When this application is running, even though it isn't &quot;doing anything,&quot; nevertheless it is maintaining a connection 
with the server, and all the capabilities necessary for running an LZX application have actually been downloaded.</p>
<p>
There are four primary components within the Laszlo Foundation Classes: the Event System, the Data Loader/Binder, the Layout &amp; 
Animation system and a set of Application Services.</p>

<h3>The Event System</h3>

<p>The event system recognizes and handles application events such as
user mouse clicks or server data pushes. This component permits
standard event-based programming on the client. Relative to conventional Web implementations, Laszlo applications typically  
reduce the processing load placed on the host server, by enabling
tasks such as client-side sorting, processing, validation, and dynamic
display across all application states.</p>

<h3>The Data Loader/Binder</h3>

<p>The data loader serves as a data traffic director, accepting data streams
across the network from the Presentation Server and binding data to
appropriate visual display elements such as text fields, forms, and
menu items.</p>

<h3>The Layout and Animation System</h3>

<p>The layout and animation system provides Laszlo applications with
<glossterm>constraint-based</glossterm> screen layout of interface
elements and <glossterm>algorithmic animation</glossterm> of interface
state changes. This component enables you to build a dynamic
application interface with minimal programming. It allows you to
position a variable number of interface elements using either relative
positioning or absolute pixel positioning. With the animation
algorithms, screen interface updates are rendered in a visually
continuous manner, clearly communicating the application's state
changes to the user. </p>

<h3>Laszlo Services System</h3>

<p>        
The Laszlo runtime includes support 
for timers, sound and modal dialogs.</p>


<h2>Data Flow of a Laszlo Application</h2>

<p>This example uses a Laszlo application stored on the Laszlo
Presentation Server as <code>weather.lzx</code>. The following diagram
illustrates how this application would be executed by the Laszlo
Presentation Server.</p>

<img class="illustration" src="images/architecture-5.gif"
     title="Laszlo Application Data Flow diagram for the Weather Application"/>

<p>Starting with a user's entering a URL that requests the Weather application, this diagram illustrates the data flow
 sequence from client to server, integrating data from an XML Web service, and sending the result back to the client.</p>

<p>
In Laszlo applications, presentation-related logic is separated from business logic and executed locally on the client. The Laszlo 
server sends the client compressed binary data rather than text, reducing the amount of data transported in 
comparison to HTML-based and other Web applications. Caching on both the server and client eliminates unnecessary code execution and
 data transmission.</p>

<h2>Security Model</h2>

<p>
The Laszlo application platform supports the SSL security model. Laszlo data transmissions across the Internet can 
be encrypted using 
SSL encryption over HTTPS. Laszlo applications execute on the client computer within the secure &quot;sandbox&quot; environment of
 the 
Flash Player, and cannot write to the local file system or access the client's native environment.</p>

<p>
Web services and databases used by a Laszlo application are also secured using a per-user authentication model. This 
mechanism prevents use of the Laszlo Presentation Server as a proxy or gateway into insecure services or data.</p>

<h2>Platform Support for Multiple Devices</h2>

<p>
The Laszlo architecture is designed to support multiple device types. Its dynamic layout mechanisms enable simple modifications to such properties as an application's overall 
size to be intelligently applied by the platform. This simplifies adapting an application to work on screens and devices of different size.</p>

<p>All screen visualizations in Laszlo use time-based rather than
frame-based animation, and thus transparently accommodate the
processor speed differences of various device types. An interface
transition specified to take 500 milliseconds will take 500
milliseconds regardless of the number of frames shown &#x2014; faster
processors result in more frames and smoother animation, but the same
duration of transition.</p>
