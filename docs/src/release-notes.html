    <h1>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo @VERSIONID@</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>OpenLaszlo @VERSIONID@ is a major release, with almost 300 bugs fixed since OpenLaszlo 4.2
      introduced the SWF9 runtime. It is the recommended platform for all application development in
      the SWF8, SWF9, and DHTML runtimes.</p>

    <p>For those of you who have already upgraded your applications to OpenLaszlo 4.2, no further
      work is needed. You should just start using OpenLaszlo @VERSIONID@.</p>

    <p>To migrate your 4.0.X or 4.1.1 applications, we strongly suggest that you refer to this wiki
      page: <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Runtime_Differences#Upgrading_to_OpenLaszlo_4.2" target="_blank">Runtime_Differences</a>. This page discusses the changes required by SWF9
      and also provides a methodology for upgrading your application. It is very important that you
      run the automated conversion scripts in the recommended order, should you choose to take
      advantage of them.</p>

    <p>This release has been fully tested on the following operating systems/browser/runtime
      platforms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows XP, Internet Explorer 7: SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
      <li>Windows XP, Firefox 3: SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
      <li>Linux 2.6 kernel, Firefox 3: SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
      <li>Mac OS X, Firefox 3: SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
      <li>Mac OS X, Safari 3: SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that although we have also done some testing with Windows Vista, OpenLaszlo 4.2
      has not been fully qualified against that operating system at this time. Please see <a href="#windowsvista">
        <i>Running OpenLaszlo Server on Windows Vista</i>
      </a> for more information.</p>

    <p>The current charting and graphing remain at a beta level, while the new charting and graphing
      API is out for review - see: <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Charting_API_Change_Proposal" target="_blank">http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Charting_API_Change_Proposal</a>. Please email <a href="mailto:laszlo-dev@openlaszlo.org">laszlo-dev@openlaszlo.org</a> with your comments. In
      addition, SOAP support is still incomplete and would be a welcome task for community
      involvement. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please send us an <a href="mailto:contributions@openlaszlo.org">email</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>For every release, we rely on the OpenLaszlo community to help ensure the quality of the
      platform release and to determine its future direction. To propose or participate in
      discussion of new features, see the <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Enhancement_Proposals" target="_blank">Wiki</a>. We encourage you to report any problems, and to make suggestions
      for enhancements, through our <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP"> bug
        tracking system</a>. We'd also like to hear from you on the <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/lists" target="_blank">mailing lists</a> and in the <a href="http://forum.openlaszlo.org/" target="_blank">forums</a>.</p>

    <h2>Improved Debugger to deal with deep and circular objects when printing</h2>
    <p>The 4.3 release adds two new properties of Debug: <code>printDepth:Number</code>
      (default 8) limits how deep the debug printer will go into an object when printing it;
        <code>inspectPrintDepth:Number</code> (default 1) limits how deep the debug printer will go into an object that is a property of an object when inspecting.
        The debug printer will also
      detect circular objects (rather than causing a stack overflow), at small cost in overhead.
      When an object refers to itself (however indirectly), it will be printed just as its type and
      ID.</p>
    <h2>Change to <code>this</code> behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Before 4.3 you could dynamically add attributes to an instance by saying: 
    </p>
    <code><pre>
    &lt;method &#x2026;&gt;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;this.myattr = "hello";
    &lt;/method&gt;
    </pre></code> 
    <p>
      and reference that dynamically-added attribute as if it were a declared attribute: 
    </p>
    <code><pre>
    &lt;method &#x2026;&gt;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return myattr;
    &lt;/method&gt;
    </pre></code> 
    <p>
      In 4.2 and later, only declared attributes, i.e.: 
    </p>
    <code><pre>
    &lt;attribute name="myattr" &#x2026; /&gt;
    </pre></code> 
    <p>
      can be referenced lexically (without saying <code>this.</code>).  The swf9 runtime will generate an error at compile time if you make a lexical reference to an undeclared attribute.  For the swf8 and DHTML runtimes, the old behavior is supported but deprecated and may cause a compiler warning or error in future releases. 
    </p>
    <h2>New Documentation Comments Feature</h2>
    <p>The @VERSIONID@ release adds a section at the end of every documentation page where you can
      add an example or comment that expands upon the existing documentation or shows a non-obvious
      usage of a feature (or work-around for a bug that you have already filed) in OpenLaszlo.
      Documentation bugs or feature requests should be filed in our <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP">bug tracking system</a> as in previous
      releases.</p>
    <h2>Incubator components</h2>
    <p>The @VERSIONID@ release updates incubator components to work with 4.2.</p>

    <h2>Bugs Fixed in OpenLaszlo @VERSIONID@</h2>
    <p>The @VERSIONID@ release includes almost 300 bug fixes since 4.2; we have provided links to
      our JIRA bug tracking system where you can view the details:</p>

    <h1>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 4.2</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 is the next fully-qualified release since OpenLaszlo 4.1.1, and is the
      recommended platform for all application development in the SWF8, SWF9, and DHTML runtimes.
      This release follows the interim OpenLaszlo 4.2 Beta 3 release. The major new feature in
      OpenLaszlo 4.2 is the introduction of the SWF9 runtime, which can offer significant
      performance gains. Unlike previous versions of the Flash player, SWF9 has much stronger typing
      requirements and you must modify your code to take advantage of the performance gains it
      offers. To assist you in upgrading your applications to OpenLaszlo 4.2, we have provided
      various conversion scripts depending on your application goals.</p>

    <h2>New SWF9 Compiler Switch</h2>
    <p>There is a new compiler switch in <code>WEB-INF/lps/config/lps.properties</code>:</p>

    <p>
      <code>compiler.swf9.execflex=false</code>
    </p>


    <p>This switch controls whether the flex swf9 compiler is invoked in the same Java thread as the
      LPS Server, or using a separate exec'ed process. Setting <code>execflex=false</code> will be
      more portable, as it doesn't depend on the shell and execution of a subprocess, however it
      will require more max heap memory for the LPS Server. A minimum of 1024MB is recommended for
      the <code>Java -Xmx</code> max heap memory init option.</p>

    <p>If <code>execflex</code> is set to true, the flex compiler will be invoked in a separate
      process. This will use less heap memory from the main LPS server or servlet process. On Unix
      and OSX systems, the files in <code>WEB-INF/bin/mxmlc</code> and
      <code>WEB-INF/bin/compc</code> will need to be set to executable permissions in the
      filesystem. This should happen automatically in the release, but may not be set correctly when
      deploying a WAR file using Tomcat's servlet manager; in that case those file permissions may
      need to be set by hand.</p>
    <h2>New <code>addFormat()</code> Method for <code>&lt;text&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>There is a new method on <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>, <code>addFormat()</code>, that
      does the same as format, but appends to any existing text.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="http://svn.openlaszlo.org/openlaszlo/trunk/docs/src/developers/text.html#textformat">Text Views</a> chapter of the Developer's
      Guide for a description and example.</p>

    <h2><a name="windowsvista">Running OpenLaszlo Server on Windows Vista</a></h2>

<p>There are two options. The first option is to manually ask for administrator privileges
      whenever you want to start or stop the OpenLaszlo Server.</p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>Navigate to <b>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;OpenLaszlo Server-&gt;Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right click and select <b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <b>Continue</b> when Vista displays a dialog box asking for permission.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the same procedure to select <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>.</p>

<p>The second option is to modify the application shortcuts to run as administrator whenever
      they are selected.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <b>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;OpenLaszlo Server-&gt;Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>. Right
          click and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The properties dialog box should open in the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Click on the
            <b>Advanced...</b> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the checkbox to <b>Run as administrator</b> and click the <b>OK</b> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Vista will display a dialog box
          asking for permission to change the shortcut settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Follow the same procedure for the <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>
      shortcuts.</p>

<p>Note: Microsoft Vista will still ask for permission to run as an administrator. However, you
      do not have to remember to run as an administrator each time.</p>



<h2>Bugs Fixed in OpenLaszlo 4.2</h2>
<p>The 4.2 release includes more than 600 bug fixes since the last fully-qualified release since
      release 4.1.1; we have provided a link to our JIRA bug tracking system where you can view the
      details:</p>
