<p>
A delegate is an object that calls  a specific method in a specific context
when its execute method is called. It is essentially a function pointer.
</p>
<p>
Delegates, along with <a href="event.html">events</a>, comprise Laszlo's point to point event system. A delegate represents a named method of an instance. Delegates are mostly registered with events, but they can be used anywhere a function callback would traditionally be called for: for instance, the <a href="lztimer.html">LzTimer</a> service takes a delegate as its argument when a timer is started. See the code example on the <a href="event.html">events page</a>.
