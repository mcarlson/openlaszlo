<lzelement title="Basescrollbar">
    <lztier>Base Component</lztier>
    <lzcategory>View</lzcategory>
    <lzshortdesc>
        Provides non-visual aspects of scrollbar.
    </lzshortdesc>
    <lztag>base/basescrollbar.xml</lztag>
</lzelement>

<p>If you want to create a scrollbar with a custom look, you can use
<classname>basescrollbar</classname> along with helper classes
<classname>basescrolltrack</classname>,
<classname>basescrollthumb</classname>, and
<classname>basescrollarrow</classname>. These classes will allow you
to change resources, colors, and the position or presence of various
elements.
</p>


<example title="An unconventional scrollbar">
&lt;canvas height="120" bgcolor="silver" maxtextheight="700"&gt;
  &lt;class name="myscrollbar" extends="basescrollbar" width="20"&gt;
    &lt;view name="scrolltrack" width="100%" options="releasetolayout"&gt;
      &lt;basescrolltrack x="5" direction="-1"
          width="${parent.width-10}" height="${parent.thumb.y}"
          bgcolor="yellow"/&gt;
      &lt;basescrollthumb name="thumb" x="1" width="${parent.width-2}"
          bgcolor="green" /&gt;
      &lt;basescrolltrack x="5" direction="1"
          y="${parent.thumb.y+parent.thumb.height}"
          width="${parent.width-10}"
          height="${parent.height - parent.thumb.y - parent.thumb.height}"
          bgcolor="yellow"/&gt;
    &lt;/view&gt;

    &lt;basescrollarrow direction="-1"
        x="2" bgcolor="yellow" &gt;
        &lt;text&gt;up&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/basescrollarrow&gt;

    &lt;basescrollarrow direction="1"
        x="2" bgcolor="yellow" &gt;
      &lt;text&gt;dn&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;/basescrollarrow&gt;
    &lt;resizelayout spacing="4"/&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;

  &lt;view x="10" y="10" bgcolor="white"
        width="200" height="100" clip="true"&gt;
    &lt;text multiline="true" width="180"&gt;
      Man through his scientific genius has been able to draw distance and
      save time and space. He has been able to carry highways through the
      stratosphere. We read just the other day that a rocket plane went 1900
      miles in one hour. Twice as fast as the speed of sound. This is the
      new age. Bob Hope has described this new age, this jet age; it is an
      age in which planes will be moving so fast that we will have a
      non-stop flight from New York to Los Angeles, when you start out you
      might develop the hiccups and you will hic in New York and cup in Los
      Angeles. This is an age in which it will be possible to leave Tokyo on
      a Sunday morning and arrive in Seattle, Washington on the preceding
      Saturday night. When your friends meet you at the airport and ask what
      time did you leave Tokyo, you will have to say I left tomorrow. That
      is this new age.  We live in one world geographically. We face the
      great problem of making it one spiritually.
      &lt;br/&gt;
      Through our scientific means we have made of the world a
      neighborhood and now the challenge confronts us through our
      moral and spiritual means to make of it a brotherhood. We must
      live together, we are not independent we are interdependent. We
      are all involved in a single process. Whatever affects one
      directly affects all indirectly for we are tied together in a
      single progress. We are all linked in the great chain of
      humanity.

  &lt;/view&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</example>

<p>Scrollbar arrows are optional or may be placed anywhere within the
scrollbar.  The thumb and track elements expect to be inside a view
named <varname>scrolltrack</varname>.  It may seem odd that the
scrolltrack is placed twice, but this allows a more flexible
appearance as well as particular behaviors that you may want to
trigger differently when the user clicks the track to scroll up or
down.</p>

<p>For another example of using <classname>basescrollbar</classname>,
you can look at lps/components/lz/scrollbar.lzx to see the code for
the lz <classname>scrollbar</classname> class.  An easy way to make
your own scrollbar is to copy that file and replace resources and
modify attributes or views to suit your design goals.
