    <p>
    SyncTester is an extension of TestCase that is useful for testing 
    objects whose method are to be called sequentially, in effect synchronizing
    methods with potentially asynchronous behavior.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To take advantage of this helper class, you must declare a dataset 
    named "&lt;instance name&gt;_methods", with a root node whose children are the 
    method names to be called synchronously. The method nodes must be named 
    "call", and  have at least the "name" attribute defined. If the method 
    needs to be called with arguments, specify them as value of the optional 
    "args" attribute (only one argument is currently supported). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Your specific tests will only run once a method returns. It is possible to
    provide an inspector method for each of the asynchronous methods declared;
    you reference it with the "tester" attribute of a node in the dataset. These
    inspector methods must be defined on the SyncTester object. If you don't 
    specify a tester for a method, the default handler named <method>inspect</method> 
    will be called with the result of the method call as an argument. You should 
    override this method if you want to have a generic inspector for most or 
    all of your methods.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Generally speaking, you would expect that an event is sent when a method 
    is done. This framework allows you to specify what event indicates the end
    of method execution by declaring the "event" attribute. It is assumed that 
    the sender of the event is the object referenced by the 
    <attribute>tested_object</attribute> attribute, or that the following method
    accepts a delegate to call on completion, as the last argument. If neither of
    these assumptions is correct, the flow of method execution will break.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For example, if you have an instance of this class named "userinfo", then 
    your list of methods might be declared like this:
    
    <pre>
    &lt;dataset name="userinfo_methods"&gt;
        &lt;suite&gt;
            &lt;call name="isAuthenticated" args="admin"/&gt;
            &lt;call name="getExpiration" event="ondata"/&gt;
            &lt;call name="createAccount" event="onload" tester="checkAcct"/&gt;
        &lt;/suite&gt;
    &lt;/dataset&gt;
    </pre>
    </p>
