<lzelement title="Animatorgroup">
    <lztier>LFC</lztier>
    <lzcategory>Animation</lzcategory>
    <lzshortdesc>
        Coordinates the behavior of several animators.
    </lzshortdesc>
    <lztag>tag-animatorgroup.xml</lztag>
    <lzapi>api-lzanimatorgroup.xml</lzapi>
</lzelement>

<p>An <classname>LzAnimatorGroup</classname> wraps several
<classname>LzAnimator</classname>s, and runs them in sequence or
simultaneously . As an example, the code below animates a view first
along the x-axis and then the y.</p>
  
<example extract="false">
&lt;canvas&gt;
  &lt;view bgcolor="red" width="100" height="100"&gt;
    &lt;animatorgroup process="sequential"&gt;
      &lt;animator attribute="x" to="100" duration="1000"/&gt;
      &lt;animator attribute="y" to="100" duration="1000"/&gt;
    &lt;/animatorgroup&gt;
  &lt;/view&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</example>

<p>Any attribute that is legal in <tagname>animator</tagname> is legal
in <tagname>animatorgroup</tagname>. These attributes are then
cascaded to the animators contained within.</p>

<p>Events (such as <event>onstart</event>, <event>onstop</event>,
etc.) and the <attribute>name</attribute> and
<attribute>id</attribute> attributes, however, are not cascaded.
Also, <attribute>start</attribute> defined at the group level is
effectively cascaded to the animators, meaning that the start
attribute is ignored in the animators themselves.</p>

<!--

<p> Also, animatorgroups can be contained within animatorgroups allowing for the encapsuation of more complex behavior.
This next example illustrates that point, by having the view now return back to its original position which requires
the object to be animated along both the x and y axis simultaneously after its initial movements on them separately.</p>

<example class="program" id="animatorgroup-2">
&lt;canvas&gt;
  &lt;view bgcolor="red" width="100" height="100"  &gt;
    &lt;animatorgroup process="sequential" &gt;
      &lt;animator attribute="x" to="100" duration="1000" /&gt;
      &lt;animator attribute="y" to="100" duration="1000" /&gt;
      &lt;animatorgroup  process="simultaneous" duration="1000" &gt;
        &lt;animator attribute="x" to="0" /&gt;
        &lt;animator attribute="y" to="0" /&gt;
      &lt;/animatorgroup&gt;
    &lt;/animatorgroup&gt; 
  &lt;/view&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</example>


<p> Note, that in the code above there was no duration set for the x
and y animators of the interior animatorgroup.  Attributes such as
duration, x, y, width, etc. can be defined in an animatorgroup and
these values will be adopted by every subanimator unless they already
have that attribute defined for themselves. If, as in the example
above, a duration value is assigned to an animated group, it does not
necessarily mean that the animatiorgroup will be confined to that
amount of time.  It means that every subanimator may use that
duration. If the process='simultaneous' and each subanimator uses the
group duration as their value then the length of total time for all
subanimators would equal the duration time for the animatorgroup</p>
