    <h1>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 4.2</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 follows OpenLaszlo 4.2 Beta 3 as the next build from the trunk development
      branch, and is the first fully-qualified release since release 4.1.1. The primary goal of this release is to 
      provide beta-level support for SWF9
      features<!-- as indicated below-->.</p>
    <!--    <p>Release 4.2 highlights include:</p>
    <p>bulleted list of new features</p>-->
    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 is not a fully-qualified release. It has had limited testing for specific
      features. This release is intended as a platform for initial porting and testing of SWF9
      applications.</p>

    <h2>Running OpenLaszlo Server on Windows Vista</h2>

    <p>There are two options. The first option is to manually ask for administrator privileges
      whenever you want to start or stop the OpenLaszlo Server.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>

        <p>Navigate to <b>Start->All Programs->OpenLaszlo Server->Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Right click and select <b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <b>Continue</b> when Vista displays a dialog box asking for permission.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use the same procedure to select <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>.</p>

    <p>The second option is to modify the application shortcuts to run as administrator whenever
      they are selected.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Start->All Programs->OpenLaszlo Server->Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>. Right
          click and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The properties dialog box should open in the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Click on the
            <b>Advanced...</b> button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click on the checkbox to <b>Run as administrator</b> and click the <b>OK</b> button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Vista will display a dialog box
          asking for permission to change the shortcut settings.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Follow the same procedure for the <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>
      shortcuts.</p>

    <p>Note: Microsoft Vista will still ask for permission to run as an administrator. However, you
      do not have to remember to run as an administrator each time.</p>

    <h2>New SWF9 Compiler Switch</h2>
    <p>There is a new compiler switch in <code>WEB-INF/lps/config/lps.properties</code>:</p>


    <p>
      <code>compiler.swf9.execflex=false</code>
    </p>


    <p>This switch controls whether the flex swf9 compiler is invoked in the same Java thread as the
      LPS Server, or using a seperate exec'ed process. Setting <code>execflex=false</code> will be
      more portable, as it doesn't depend on the shell and execution of a subprocess, however it
      will require more max heap memory for the LPS Server. A minimum of 1024MB is recommended for
      the <code>Java -Xmx</code> max heap memory init option.</p>

    <p>If <code>execflex</code> is set to true, the flex compiler will be invoked in a separate
      process. This will use less heap memory from the main LPS server or servlet process. On Unix
      and OSX systems, the files in <code>WEB-INF/bin/mxmlc</code> and
      <code>WEB-INF/bin/compc</code> will need to be set to executable permissions in the
      filesystem. This should happen automatically in the release, but may not be set correctly when
      deploying a WAR file using Tomcat's servlet manager; in that case those file permissions may
      need to be set by hand.</p>
    <h2>New <code>addFormat()</code> Method for <code>&lt;text&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>There is a new method on <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>, <code>addFormat()</code>, that
    does the same as format, but appends to any existing text.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="developers/text.html#textformat">Text Views</a> chapter of the Developer's Guide for a description and example.</p>

    <h2>Bugs Fixed in OpenLaszlo 4.2</h2>
    <p>The 4.2 release includes more than 600 bug fixes since the last fully-qualified release since release 4.1.1; we have provided
      a link to our JIRA bug tracking system where you can view the details:</p>
