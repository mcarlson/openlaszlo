    <h1>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 4.2 Alpha</h1>

    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 Alpha follows OpenLaszlo 4.1.1 as the next build from the trunk development
      branch. The primary goal of this release is to provide alpha-level support for SWF9 features
      as indicated below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The sample applications LZPIX, Weather, and Component Sampler work with SWF9 <br />To
        compile these applications to SWF9, navigate to the OpenLaszlo Quick Index, click on the
        link for the desired application, click the SWF9 radio button, and compile.</li>
      <li>SWF9 installation packaged w/flex compiler <br />Installing OpenLaszlo with the flex
        compiler is one step.</li>
      <li>databinding and basic replication</li>

      <li>"implicit this" support<br />Note that there is a compiler limitation that "super" cannot
        be used in methods in <code>&lt;state&gt;</code>s.</li>

      <li>Text, fonts, scrolling, and selection APIs</li>

      <li>Keyboard and mouse events</li>

      <li>Multi-frame resource support</li>

      <li>Image loading</li>
      <li>Resource stretching</li>

      <li>Script tag support</li>

      <li>XML-RPC support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 Alpha is not a fully-qualified release. It has had limited testing for
      specific features. This release is intended as a platform for initial porting and testing of
      SWF9 applications.</p>
    <h2>Installation Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For SWF9 development on Unix, you will need to manually <code>chmod 755</code> all the
        binaries in <code>WEB-INF/server/bin/</code> before you can compile. This is true for both
        the <code>.war</code> and <code>.gz</code> distributions.</li>
      <li>The installation works best with JDK 1.6, although any version 1.5 or higher is acceptable.</li>
    </ul>
