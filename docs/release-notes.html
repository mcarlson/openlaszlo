<h1><b>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 3.3.1 </b> </h1>

<p class="bodytext">

<p>OpenLaszlo 3.3.1 is a small point release that fixes one issue. There was a regression involving the behavior of <code>simplelayout</code>. Code was checked in for OpenLaszlo 3.3 that broke the <code>simplelayout</code> behavior. We have removed that code. The correct behavior, now provided in OpenLaszlo 3.3.1, is that <code>simplelayout</code> should only apply to a single axis.</p>
<p>
The remaining portion of these release notes describe the changes in OpenLaszlo 3.3, which is the next fully-qualified, significant release after OpenLaszlo 3.2. OpenLaszlo 3.3 contains primarily bug fixes and many new contributions and bug fixes from the OpenLaszlo community. OpenLaszlo 3.3 also introduces a French translation of the documentation, as well as a number of ongoing documentation improvements.
</p>
<p>
For every release, we rely on the OpenLaszlo community to help ensure
the quality of the platform release and to determine its future
direction. We encourage you to report any problems, and to make
suggestions for enhancements, through our <a
href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP">JIRA bug tracking
system.</a>
</p>
<p>
Here is a summary of what you will find in these notes:

<h1><a name="key-features">New Features in OpenLaszlo 3.3</a></h1> 
<p>
The majority of new features in OpenLaszlo 3.3 are contributions to the incubator. However, there have also been some smaller additions to other areas of the source code.

<h2>New Features in OpenLaszlo Source Code</h2>
Some of the new features are listed here:
<ul>

<li>Created a new <code>textalign</code> attribute for gridtext (found
here <code>/lps/components/lz/gridtext.lzx</code>). Contributed by
Luca
Ritossa. (<a
href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1999">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1999</a>) </li><br>

<li>Added a new <code>allowdrag</code> to basewindow. This attribute
defaults to true so all applications that expect windows to be
draggable will work as normal. Also modified the
method <code>_startDrag</code>. The drag now only occurs if <code>allowdrag</code> equals true. Also added the attribute <code>allowdrag</code> to
datepicker. This attribute defaults to true. Defined the attribute
<code>allowdrag</code> for the windowpanel <code>main</code>. This attribute is
tied to the value defined in the datepicker
class. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-901">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-901</a>)</li><br>

<li>Added compiler support for video object, which is one step towards supporting streaming video (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1678">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1678</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h2>New Features in the OpenLaszlo Incubator</h2>
<p>
The <a
href="http://svn.openlaszlo.org/openlaszlo/tags/3.3.0/lps/components/incubator/">incubator
directory</a> contains components and other code that have been
contributed to the OpenLaszlo project, but have not yet been fully
integrated into the product. It is intended as an easy way to
contribute code that doesn't have the level of documentation, testing,
or API review that is required in other directories, or that is simply
contributed too late in the release cycle to place elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
There have been many new items added to the incubator in this release
thanks to the members of the OpenLaszlo community. Here is a listing
of some of the newest items that you may find useful in your
applications:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improvements to the gradient drawing calls in pie charts. Contributed by Sebastian Barthelmess. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2001">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2001</a>)</li><br>

	<li>A vertical slider, <code>vslider.lzx</code>. Contributed by Sebastian Wagner. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1998">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1998</a>)</li><br>
	<li>A horizontal split panel, <code>hsplitpane.lzx</code>. Contributed by Daniel Kim. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994</a>)</li><br>
	<li>An autocomplete variant of combobox, <code>autocompletecombobox.lzx</code>. Contributed by Daniel Kim. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994</a>)</li><br>
	<li>Four significant improvements to the tooltip manager, <code>tooltipmanager.lzx</code>:<br> 
<ol>Fixed a mem leak with destroy. Now only uses one obj for the tooltip.</ol> <ol>Reads in the msgs from a dataset to allow easier internationalization.</ol> <ol>Made it easy to override default tooltip gui.</ol><ol>Simplified registration of tooltip.</ol> Contributed by Daniel Kim. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1994</a>)</li><br>
 
<li>A time validator based on the validator utilities contributed previously by Togawa Manabu. Time validator contributed by Luca Ritossa. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1972">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1972</a>)</li><br>

<li>A view with a customizable border. Contributed by Brad Erickson. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1971">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1971</a>)</li><br>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation Improvements</h2>
<p>
Since OpenLaszlo 3.2, there have many documentation improvements. There is a new French translation of the <i>Software Engineer's Guide to Developing OpenLaszlo Applications</i> based on OpenLaszlo 3.2. Please refer to the <code>README.txt</code> (English) file or <code>LISEZ-MOI.txt</code> (French) file found in <code>/docs/guide_fr</code> for instructions on building and using the French documentation. Thanks to Morgan Duchene for this contribution. (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1993">http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1993</a>)</p>
<p>
There have been many ongoing documentation improvements as well. The most notable areas of change include: updating all of the examples to use the new event syntax; adding a link to the wiki page (<a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/MediaSupport">http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/MediaSupport</a>) to clarify all supported media types; and significantly rewriting the documentation to integrate the SOLO tips as a tutorial as well as updating information about SOLO deployments.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that the documentation is virtually always under
development. For the most up-to-date version, you may want to consult
<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/documentation">the nightly build of
the documentation</a> hosted on OpenLaszlo.org. (The latest
documentation may include information pertinent to the next-following
release (e.g. 4.0) and therefore will not necessarily be accurate for
3.3; however, it will include ongoing general improvements.)
</p>

<h1><a name="fixed-bugs">Significant Bugs Fixed</a></h1>
<p>
There have been many bugs fixed since the 3.2 release. Consult <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10020&styleName=Html&version=10182">JIRA</a> for complete information. 

Some of the more notable bug fixes include:
<ul>
<li>The <code>lzc.bat</code> file is fixed in the windows distribution.</li><br>

<li>There have been numerous bug fixes for <code>datacombobox</code> including:
fixed a problem where the floating list appeared in the wrong position
the first time it was shown
(<a
href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1689">LPP-1689</a>);
added warnings when <code>valuedatapath</code> is not set correctly
(<a
href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1877">LPP-1877</a>);
Improved memory and performance for layouts with large numbers of
components by destroying the floating list whenever the
<code>datacombobox/floatinglist pair</code> loses focus (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1932">LPP-1932</a>, <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2019">LPP-2019</a>); fixed
errors in focus advance (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2020">LPP-2020</a>); ensured that tab closes the menu and goes to the next component in tab order, while shift-tab closes the menu and leaves focus in <code>datacombobox</code> (<a
href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2024">LPP-2024</a>); and cleaned up warnings on <code>font</code>
and <code>fontsize</code> in <code>lz/datacombobox</code> (<a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2023">LPP-2023</a>) </li><br>

<li>You can once again set custom headers in HTTP requests (through LPS proxy service).</li><br>

<li>Helpful hint: In OpenLaszlo 3.2, we changed the default for the
dataset "trimwhitespace" property from "true" to "false" to make the
data loading match the defaults for XML loading in DHTML and in
SWF. You should be able to get the old behavior by
specifying &lt;<code>dataset trimwhitespace="true"</code>&gt;. </li>

</ul>


<h1><a name="Known">Known Problems and Workarounds</a></h1>

<p>
For the most current and complete information, consult the <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP">JIRA</a> bug database.
</p>
<p>
There are two particular problems that we would like to call to your attention:
<h2>Mouseovers and Animators</h2>
<p>
There is a common "UI" design pattern that is easily implemented within OpenLaszlo. This implementation, however, reveals a bug that
some developers have encountered. In this particular UI design, a view is expanded in some dimension on rollover of the mouse and
contracted upon mouseout. The code is often written like the following:
</p>


<pre>
&lt;canvas&gt;
   &lt;view width="100" height="100" bgcolor="blue"
         onmouseover="this.expand.doStart()"
         onmouseout="this.contract.doStart()" &gt;
       &lt;animator name="expand"   attribute="width" to="150"  duration="500" /&gt;
       &lt;animator name="contract" attribute="width" to="100"  duration="500" /&gt;
   &lt;/view&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The visual effect of the above code will fail, however, if the mouse is  moved so fast by the user that
the 2nd mouseover event occurs before the first expand animation is complete.
</p>
<p>
In other words, calling doStart() on an animator that is already running does nothing. It seems that the view has missed the 2nd mouseover event, when in actuality it is the animator that ignored  its doStart() method call because it was already running.
</p>

<p>
For now, the work around is to use the javascript interface for animators like the following.
</p>


<pre>
&lt;canvas&gt;
   &lt;view width="100" height="100" bgcolor="red"
         onmouseover=" this.animate('width',150,500) "
         onmouseout="  this.animate('width',100,500) " /&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In this case, new animators are created with each new mouse event. These animators will run independently and will not have the same problems associated with them like those encountered with the animator tags. Run the examples above,
and move the mouse quickly in and out of both views. Notice how in the second example the motion of the red box seems more natural.
 
</p>
<h2>Applications Embedded in IE</h2>
<p>
Users have reported problems with applications embedded in some versions of Internet Explorer -- the applications don't appear. If you can't get your OpenLaszlo application to show up in IE, try using the older version of embed.js from 3.0.2. We couldn't fix it because we couldn't reproduce the problem, but using older versions of the embed.js sometimes made the problem go away.
