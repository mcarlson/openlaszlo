    <h1>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 4.2</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>OpenLaszlo 4.2 is the next fully-qualified release since OpenLaszlo
4.1.1, and is the recommended platform  for all application development in the SWF8, SWF9, and DHTML runtimes. This release follows the interim OpenLaszlo 4.2 Beta 3 release. The major new feature in OpenLaszlo 4.2 is the introduction of the SWF9 runtime, which can offer significant performance gains. Unlike previous versions of the Flash player, SWF9 has much stronger typing requirements and you must modify your code to take advantage of the performance gains it offers. To assist you in upgrading your applications to OpenLaszlo 4.2, we have provided various conversion scripts depending on your application goals.</p>

<p>To migrate your 4.0.X or 4.1.1 applications, we
strongly suggest that you refer to this wiki page:
<a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Runtime_Differences#Upgrading_to_OpenLaszlo_4.2" target="_blank">Runtime_Differences</a>. This page discusses the changes required by SWF9 and also provides a methodology for upgrading your application. It is very important that you run the automated conversion scripts in the recommended order,
should you choose to take advantage of them. </p>

<p>This release has been fully tested on the following operating systems/browser/runtime platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP IE7 SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
<li>Windows XP FF3 SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
<li>Linux 2.6 kernel FF3 SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
<li>Mac OS X FF3 SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
<li>Mac OS X SAF3 SWF8, SWF9, DHTML</li>
</ul>
<p>where: IE7 is Internet Explorer 7; FF3 is Firefox 3; and SAF3 is
Safari 3. Please note that although we have also done some testing
with Windows Vista, OpenLaszlo 4.2 has not been fully qualified
against that operating system at this time. Please see the section below, <i>Running OpenLaszlo Server on Windows Vista</i>, for more information.</p>

<p>As with any initial release of a new runtime platform, there will be edge cases that have problems. For OpenLaszlo 4.2, incubator components have not yet been updated to run; the same is true for the charting and graphing utilities, which continue to remain at a beta level. SOAP support is another area that is still very rough. These are straightforward tasks that would welcome community involvement. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please send us an <a href="mailto:laszlo-dev@openlaszlo.org">email</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For every release, we rely on the OpenLaszlo community to help ensure the quality of the platform release and to determine its future direction. To propose or participate in discussion of new features, see the <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Enhancement_Proposals" target="_blank">Wiki</a>. We encourage you to report any problems, and to make suggestions for enhancements, through our <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP"> bug tracking system</a>. We'd also like to hear from you on the <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/lists" target="_blank">mailing lists</a> and in the <a href="http://forum.openlaszlo.org/" target="_blank">forums</a>.</p>


    <h2>New SWF9 Compiler Switch</h2>
    <p>There is a new compiler switch in <code>WEB-INF/lps/config/lps.properties</code>:</p>


    <p>
      <code>compiler.swf9.execflex=false</code>
    </p>


    <p>This switch controls whether the flex swf9 compiler is invoked in the same Java thread as the
      LPS Server, or using a separate exec'ed process. Setting <code>execflex=false</code> will be
      more portable, as it doesn't depend on the shell and execution of a subprocess, however it
      will require more max heap memory for the LPS Server. A minimum of 1024MB is recommended for
      the <code>Java -Xmx</code> max heap memory init option.</p>

    <p>If <code>execflex</code> is set to true, the flex compiler will be invoked in a separate
      process. This will use less heap memory from the main LPS server or servlet process. On Unix
      and OSX systems, the files in <code>WEB-INF/bin/mxmlc</code> and
      <code>WEB-INF/bin/compc</code> will need to be set to executable permissions in the
      filesystem. This should happen automatically in the release, but may not be set correctly when
      deploying a WAR file using Tomcat's servlet manager; in that case those file permissions may
      need to be set by hand.</p>
    <h2>New <code>addFormat()</code> Method for <code>&lt;text&gt;</code></h2>
    <p>There is a new method on <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>, <code>addFormat()</code>, that
    does the same as format, but appends to any existing text.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="developers/text.html#textformat">Text Views</a> chapter of the Developer's Guide for a description and example.</p>

<h2>Running OpenLaszlo Server on Windows Vista</h2>

    <p>There are two options. The first option is to manually ask for administrator privileges
      whenever you want to start or stop the OpenLaszlo Server.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>

        <p>Navigate to <b>Start->All Programs->OpenLaszlo Server->Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Right click and select <b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <b>Continue</b> when Vista displays a dialog box asking for permission.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use the same procedure to select <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>.</p>

    <p>The second option is to modify the application shortcuts to run as administrator whenever
      they are selected.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Start->All Programs->OpenLaszlo Server->Start OpenLaszlo Server</b>. Right
          click and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The properties dialog box should open in the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Click on the
            <b>Advanced...</b> button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click on the checkbox to <b>Run as administrator</b> and click the <b>OK</b> button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Shortcut</b> tab. Vista will display a dialog box
          asking for permission to change the shortcut settings.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Follow the same procedure for the <b>Stop OpenLaszlo Server</b> or <b>OpenLaszlo Explorer</b>
      shortcuts.</p>

    <p>Note: Microsoft Vista will still ask for permission to run as an administrator. However, you
      do not have to remember to run as an administrator each time.</p>
