<h1><b>Release Notes for OpenLaszlo 3.2 </b> </h1>

<p class="bodytext">

<p>
OpenLaszlo 3.2 is a "community release" of the platform. This release has been partially tested and is believed to be stable, but it is not a fully-qualified release. The purpose of this release it to give you, the OpenLaszlo developer community, a chance to try out some of the new features we've been working on as we move towards our next major release in Spring, 2006. The most recent fully qualified release is 3.1.1 (December, 2005). The most recent major release is 3.1 (November, 2005)</p>
<p>
There have been a few significant new features added to OpenLaszlo since Release 3.1.1, and many bugs have been fixed. There have also been significant improvements to the documentation.
</p>
<p>
Also please note that the documentation is virtually always under development. For the most up-to-date version, you may want to consult <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/docs/nightly/">the nightly build</a> hosted on OpenLaszlo.org. (The latest documentation may include information pertinent to the upcoming release and therefore will not necessarily be accurate for 3.2; however, it will also include general improvements.)
</p>
<p>
The OpenLaszlo development team depends on you, the users of the platform, to help us ensure its quality and determine its future direction. We encourage you to report any problems, and to make suggestions for enhancements, through our <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP">bug tracking system.</a>
</p>
<p>
Here is a summary of what you will find in these notes:

<h1><a name="key-features">New Features since OpenLaszlo 3.1.1</a></h1> 
<p>
Since release 3.1.1, the following features have been added to OpenLaszlo:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>New goodies in the incubator </li>
	<li>CSS support in incubator (LPP-824)</li>
	<li>&lt;img&gt; tags within rich text views (LPP-874)</li>
	<li>MSAA-compatible accessibility (LPP-872)</li>
	<li>Rich text editor palette in incubator (LPP-873)</li>
	<li>JavaScript compiler ported from Jython to Java (LPP-752)</li>
	<li>Automated unit tests</li>
	<li>New &lt;handler&gt; and &lt;event&gt; syntax</li>

</ul>

<h2>New goodies in the incubator</h2>
<p> 
The Incubator directory, <tt>lps/components/incubator/</tt>, contains components and other code that have been contributed to the OpenLaszlo project, but have not yet been fully integrated into the product. It is intended as an easy way to contribute code that doesn't have the level of documentation, testing, or API review that is required in other directories, or that is simply contributed too late in the release cycle to place elsewhere. Some of the more significant contributions are called out below.
</p>
<p>
In addition there are several new gadgets and gizmos in the incubator, mostly courtesy of the LaszloMail team. Have a look!
</p>
<h2>CSS support in incubator (LPP-824)</h2>
<p>
The incubator now contains an implementation of CSS applied to OpenLaszlo.  Documentation is included.  Please note that this is an incubator project and as such it's subject to change, and there is no guarantee that it will ever formally make it into the platform. 
</p>
<h2>&lt;img&gt; tags within rich text views (LPP-874)</h2>
<p>
A partial implementation of the HTML &lt;img&gt; tag allows you to include images within HTML text.  There are some limitations; please see the documentation.</p>
<h2>MSAA-compatible accessibility (LPP-872)</h2>
<p>
By using Active Accessibility and following accessible design practices, developers can make applications running on Windows more accessible to many people with vision, hearing, or motion disabilities. OpenLaszlo now includes a partial implementation of this specification, with some limitations that depend on the target runtime.  Please see the documentation. 
</p>

<h2>rich text editor palette in incubator (LPP-873)</h2>
<p>
A contribution from the LaszloMail team.
</p>
<h2>
JavaScript compiler ported from Jython to Java (LPP-752)</h2>
<p>
Much faster compilation.
</p>
<h2>Automated unit tests</h2>
<p>
For those who build OpenLaszlo from sources. 
The cool thing about automated unit tests is 'ant runlzunit', which automatically runs the known unit tests against a build.
</p>
<h2>New &lt;handler&gt; and &lt;event&gt; syntax</h2>
<p>
There is a new syntax for declaring events and event handlers.  The old syntax still works, but we came up with this new style because people find the current syntax somewhat obscure, and anonymous methods sometimes have unanticipated results.
</p>
<p>
The documentation has not caught up with the new syntax, but there is a <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/Event_and_handler_tags">wiki</a> page that contains the specification:</p>


<H1><a name="backwards">Backwards-incompatible Changes</a></H1> 
<p>
The KRANK feature has been removed (LPP-871)
</p>

<h1><a name="fixed-bugs">Significant Bugs Fixed</a></h1>
<p>
Several dozens of bugs have been fixed since the 3.0.2 release. Consult <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=10120&styleName=Html&projectId=10020&Create=Create">JIRA</a> for complete information. 

<h1><a name="Known">Known Defects</a></h1>

<p>
For the most current and complete information, consult the <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/">JIRA</a> bug database.
</p>
<p>
There are two particular problems that we would like to call to your attention:
<h2>Mouseovers and animators</h2>
<p>
There is a common "UI" design pattern that is easily implemented within OpenLaszlo. This implementation, however, reveals a bug that
some developers have encountered. In this particular UI design, a view is expanded in some dimension on rollover of the mouse and
contracted upon mouseout. The code is often written like the following:
</p>


<pre>
&lt;canvas&gt;
   &lt;view width="100" height="100" bgcolor="blue"
         onmouseover="this.expand.doStart()"
         onmouseout="this.contract.doStart()" &gt;
       &lt;animator name="expand"   attribute="width" to="150"  duration="500" /&gt;
       &lt;animator name="contract" attribute="width" to="100"  duration="500" /&gt;
   &lt;/view&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The visual effect of the above code will fail, however, if the mouse is  moved so fast by the user that
the 2nd mouseover event occurs before the first expand animation is complete.
</p>
<p>
In other words, calling doStart() on an animator that is already running does nothing. It seems that the view has missed
the 2nd mouseover event, when in actuality it is the animator that ignored  its doStart() method call because it was already running.
</p>

<p>
For now, the work around is to use the javascript interface for animators like the following.
</p>


<pre>
&lt;canvas&gt;
   &lt;view width="100" height="100" bgcolor="red"
         onmouseover=" this.animate('width',150,500) "
         onmouseout="  this.animate('width',100,500) " /&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

<p>
in this case, new animators are created with each new mouse event. These animators will run independently and so
will not have the same problems associated with them like those encountered with the animator tags. Run the examples above,
and move the mouse quickly in and out of both views. Notice how in the second example the motion of the red box seems more natural.
 
</p>
<h2>Applications embedded in IE</h2>
<p>
Users have reported problems with applications embedded in some versions of Internet Explorer -- the applications don't appear. if you can't get your OpenLaszlo application to show up in IE, try using the older version of embed.js from 3.0.2. We couldn't fix it because we couldn't reproduce the problem, but using older versions of the embed.js sometimes made the problem go away.
