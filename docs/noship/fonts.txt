Here's the chapter outline I proposed as well as the snippets of
text I said I'd write:

6. Fonts.

    A. What is an LZX Font?

        Every piece of text that is drawn in a Laszlo application is 
        drawn using an LZX font.  An LZX font is a set of size-independent 
        glyphs (i.e., outlines or shapes) that should be drawn to represent 
        text characters.  An LZX font is defined by a name, style and a source 
        file where the glyphs are stored.  The name is an identifier such as 
        Courier or Garamond.  The style is one of normal, italic, bold, or 
        bold italic.  The font source file must be in industry stardard 
        TrueType format.  (See the spec at 
        http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTQualSpec/QS01/FQS1.html, the reference 
        at http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/index.html and details about 
        the file format at 
        http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6.html)
        
        This chapter shows some simple examples of using fonts in LZX.   
        It then goes on to discuss the default font, font definition elements, 
        font-related view attributes and font-related HTML
        elements.  It concludes with some tips and trouble-shooting advice.
        
        Each name and style pairing must be unique in an application.


    B. Using LZX Fonts
        Your simple examples...

            <view fontsize="" />

            <text><b>hello</b></text>

    C. The Default Font
        LZX applications come with a default font that is used by all text.

    D. Defining LZX Fonts
        All LZX fonts that an application uses must be defined.

        a. Fonts are defined/imported like other resources (see resource chapter?)
            except that they must be defined/imported at compile time.
            There is a application-global namespace for fonts.
            Each font name-stylle pairing must be unique.

        b. The <font> element must be a child of the <canvas> or <library>

            1. <font name="" style="" src="" />

            2. <font>
                  <font style="" src="" />
                  <font style="" src="" />
                  <font style="" src="" />
              </font>

        c. The system font directory $WEBAPP/WEB-INF/lps/fonts ; but don't use it.
     

    E Using LZX Fonts Again (or "The Details")
        a. LZX View Font-Related Attributes
            font
            fontsize
            fontstyle
            The default values for the canvas are lztahoe8, normal, 8.
        b. Cascading

        c. HTML Elements
            Note upper case isn't allowed (XML is case sensitive).    
            <font>
                Attributes 
                    face (The *name* of the LZX font)
                    size - point size of the font (not +1, -1)
                    color -(# syntax yes, 0x I dunno).
                    style - (bold, italic, normal, bolditalic)
            <b>
            <i>
            <u>

        d. How a View chooses its Font

            There are four ways (not including the runtime API, which is currently 
            undocumented) that you can specify a view's font:
            
                1. HTML text elements inside the view that enclose the text
                2. Font attributes on the view instance itself
                3. Font attributes on the view's class
                4. Cascaded fonts attributes
            
            A view will choose the font specified with the closest binding.
            The lower the number above, the "tighter" the binding.

            Enclosing HTML elements > Instance font > Class font > Cascaded font

    F. Tips and Trouble-shooting
        Use cascading to simplify LZX files
            This results in less code.
        Bandwidth considerations
            Fonts are big.  On average, a single font will add about
            20 Bytes to the uncompressed bandwidth required to download
            an application.
        My Text Doesn't Show Up
            If you create text at runtime using a font or style that
            is not defined in your application, text will not show up.
        Style
             bold italic and bolditalic issues
        The Italic and Bold Italic versions of lztahoe are not included by default
             (nor do we ship them).
        Don't use the system font directory.  Keep your fonts with your app.

        Pixel-Accuracy

            LZX fonts are outline fonts.  This means the same shapes (glyph definitions)
            are used regardless of point size and this often results in blurry text
            at small sizes.  To create pixel-accurate text, it is possible to 
            carefully construct fonts that will not blur when drawn at certain 
            point sizes.  

            The LPS comes with a number of such "pseudo"-pixel fonts for your use.  See
            the system font directory ($WEBAPP/WEB-INF/lps/fonts).  Fonts with 
            three and four digit numbers are constructed as such.
            
            Please contact Laszlo Customer Support (support@laszlosystems.com) for 
            details on how to build or obtain such fonts.

            See also the <view> pixellock attribute.
