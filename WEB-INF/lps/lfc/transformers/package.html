View transformers are odd beasts. They are used in the viewsystem to extend the core capabilities of views without bloating the view class definition. A view transformer takes a view instance as an argument and operates on it -- assigning new properties and methods, reassigning some methods, and registering events and delegates for special behavior. This is not standard OOP practice, but it is convenient in the performance-constrained but extremely flexible environment of the JavaScript interpreter.
