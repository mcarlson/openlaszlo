<h1>Components</h1>
  <div class="desc">
  <p>This sections demonstrates the OpenLaszlo components.
  Frequently used components each have a page that shows multiple
  ways that the components can be parameterized to have a different
  appearance or behavior.</p>
  <p>
  All OpenLaszlo components can be specified declaratively, data driven and
  modified at run-time using JavaScript. The look of a component may be changes
  using style or by modifying component resources.  
  </p>
  <p>
  All code for the components is available with the product in the /lps/components
  directory.  There are 'lz' components which have the OpenLaszlo look and feel and
  are showcases in this section.  Every 'lz' component is a subclass of a
  corresponding 'base' component, which you can subclass to make custom
  components.
