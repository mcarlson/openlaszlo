<h1>Getting Started</h1>

 
    <h3>Learn by Doing</h3>
    <p>OpenLaszlo applications are written in the XML-based language LZX. 
The best way for you to learn this language is by writing code, and this
OpenLaszlo Explorer is designed to help you start doing that quickly.
</p>

<p>
There are
    two ways in which sample source LZX code is presented here.</p>
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div class="desc-short">Code for
              the demos is presented in a 
syntax-colored viewer that displays different types of tags in different colors.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="desc-short">Code for the
            smaller applications and examples in the documentation
        are presented in an editable window that allows you to modify and save
        working code so that you can make changes and see how this affects the program.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="desc-short">
    <h3>
    Two ways to compile programs</h3>
    <p>In order to run, your LZX programs must first be compiled by the OpenLaszlo Server. There are two ways to do this:</p>
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div class="desc-short">Use the example editor.  To see the example editor, click on "OpenLaszlo in Ten Minutes", and 
then click on one of the examples. 
 When you edit the text on the left and press the "update" button, your program is compiled and presented on the right.  
This is ideal for trying out small changes, such as changing a color or adding a button, to the examples.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="desc-short">Use a text editor such as Notepad to edit text files in an application directory on your computer, 
and then type the localhost URL for these text files into the browser address.  The name of the application
directory on your system depends on how the OpenLaszlo Server has been installed and configured, as described 
<a href="../../docs/developers/program-development.html#program-development.where-to-put-files">here</a>.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
