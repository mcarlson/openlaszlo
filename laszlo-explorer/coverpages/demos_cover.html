<h1>Demos: the end of &quot;page refresh&quot;</h1>
  <div class="desc">
  <img border="0" align="left" src="images/demos-image.png" />
  
    <p>An aesthetic revolution is about to transform the web. Utilitarian web
        applications that present a confusing sequence of forms cluttered with &quot;submit&quot; buttons
        are no longer good enough. People want to enjoy interacting with the web, being gently
        guided, but never manipulated or coerced. And there is no reason that
        you cannot build the applications that will set the new standards, delighting
    your users as you do.</p>
    <p>The three applications in this section illustrate
          user interfaces that are responsive, that seamlessly transition from
          one state of the application
      to another, allowing users to see more details without requiring a page-refresh.</p>

    <p>We hope these
      demonstration programs will spark your imagination. Source code is provided. <br>
