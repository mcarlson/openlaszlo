<h1>Demos: the end of &quot;page refresh&quot;</h1>
  <div class="desc">
  <img border="0" align="left" src="images/demos_cover.jpg" alt="demo applications" />
  
    <p>An aesthetic revolution is about to transform the web. Utilitarian web
        applications that present a confusing sequence of forms cluttered with &quot;submit&quot; buttons
        are no longer good enough. People want to enjoy interacting with the web, being gently
        guided, but never manipulated or coerced. And there is no reason that
        you cannot build the applications that will set the new standards, delighting
    your users as you do.</p>
    <p>The four applications in this section illustrate
          user interfaces that are responsive, that seamlessly transition from
          one state of the application
      to another, allowing users to see more details without requiring a page-refresh.</p>
<h2>Flash or Ajax &#8212; it's your call</h2>
    <p>
The Calendar, Amazon, and LZPIX demos compile to either SWF or DHTML.
        Click the <a title="Flash Version" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600'); return false" href="../../demos/lzpix/app.lzx?lzr=swf8&amp;lzt=html"><b>Launch Flash</b></a> button and see the application compiled to run as a Flash&reg; plug-in. At any point right-click the mouse and notice that you&rsquo;re using the Flash player. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you&rsquo;ve tried the Flash application, close the browser window and click the <a title="DHTML Version" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600'); return false" href="../../demos/lzpix/app.lzx?lzr=dhtml&amp;lzt=html"><b>Launch DHTML</b></a> button. This shows the identical application compiled to run using native browser functions, without the use of Flash. Go through the same steps in the application and notice the same features and performance. Right-click the mouse at any point and notice there&rsquo;s no Flash to be found in this version. 
    </p>

    <p>We hope these
      demonstration programs will spark your imagination. Source code is provided. <br />
