<h2>About LZX</h2>

<p>LZX, the OpenLaszlo XML-based language, allows you to develop Rich
Internet Applications using industry standards such as XML,
JavaScript, and XPath.</p>

<p>LZX is an event-driven, object-oriented language for building
dynamic, data-driven applications. Because it's an XML language, LZX
integrates seamlessly with your existing IDE, source control, and team
development systems.  Using LZX, you can build groundbreaking user
interfaces using a familiar, manageable, and maintainable programmatic
approach.</p>

<h2>About this overview</h2>

features of LZX. You can go over this overview sequentially, <!--

<h3>Source code area</h3>
