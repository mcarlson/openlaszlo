This application opens in a window.  If you don't see it, you may need to
bring that window to the front.
</p><p>
This "universal canvas" brings together, in one seamless application, mail,
personal calendar, news feeds, chat, address-book and more.  Be sure to play
a tune in the media center as you experiment with the other capabilities.
</p><p>
Windows may be moved and resized; however, they also have a
"home"&#8212;their place of origin.  The minimize (-) button in the upper-right
corner sends them back, allowing you to easily manage limited
screen real-estate.
</p><p>
This is a "concept" demo and is not integrated with back-end data
providers.  However, by inspecting the code you can see how it
could be expanded into a full-featured "portal".
