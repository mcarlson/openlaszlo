This application opens in a window.  If you don't see it, you may need to
bring that window to the front.
</p><p>
This application is built around the XML data interface supplied by Amazon.com. 
It has the shopping cart, wish list and checkout functions that you would expect
to find in an ecommerce application, but none of the incessant page refreshes that you 
typically find on such sites. Information is revealed or hidden as necessary, and
communication with the back end transpires in the background without disrupting your experience. 
To see the information associated with an album, such as reviews and track listings,
double-click on the album cover image.
