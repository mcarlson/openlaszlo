<hr>
Layout managers greatly simplify the maintenance of your user

interfaces by allowing you to position components relative to each

other according to predefined logic.  For example, if you change

the size of one component, the position of the other components will be

automatically adjusted. By contrast, if you use absolute positioning

(providing x,y coordinates for each component), then changing the size

of one component generally will have a ripple effect and you will have

to manually change the position of other components. Laszlo does,

however, support absolute positioning. And, you can combine the two

approaches. Laszlo provides predefined layout managers (such as

<font class="tag">&lt;simplelayout&gt;</font> in this example). You can also create your own layout

managers from scratch, or by extending existing ones.<br>
