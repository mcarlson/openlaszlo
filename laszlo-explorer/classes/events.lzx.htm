        <p>You can also define behaviors that instances of a class should exhibit when specific
            events are triggered. In this example, we want the width of the component to grow when
            the user mouses over it, and to shrink back to its initial value when the user mouses
            out. In a real life component, this kind of behavior can be used as a visual clue to
            indicate that the component has the focus. You use the <code class="attribute"
                >onmouseover</code> and <code class="attribute">onmouseout</code> attributes of the
                <code class="tag">&lt;borderedbox&gt;</code> class to code the event
            handlers. All the instances of that class will automatically exhibit that behavior.</p>
