<b>Notes</b>
<hr>

This sample application draws three red squares. The problem with this

implementation is that if the requirements of the application change

(for example, the size or the color of the square), you have to

implement the changes at three different places. This is a trivial

example, but you can easily imagine the maintenance problem of code

duplication in a large scale application.
