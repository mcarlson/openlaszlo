LZX's powerful constraints system allows you to declaratively derive the value of a property from the value of other properties.

This system can dramatically reduce the amount of code you have to write and facilitate the maintenance of your application.<br>

In this example, constraining the visiblity of a window to the value of a checkbox, shows how easy it is for a component to control another object.
