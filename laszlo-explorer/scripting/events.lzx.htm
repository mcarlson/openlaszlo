<hr>
Events are one of the cornerstones of the LZX language. They can be referenced directly as shown above, and they are also the implicit mechanism behind constraints. 
Events can only be referenced as an attribute within the tag if it is defined with the schema for that tag, "onomousedown" is one such event.
Any event ( predefined or custom), however, can be referenced within a &lt;method&gt; tag as shown in the above example.
