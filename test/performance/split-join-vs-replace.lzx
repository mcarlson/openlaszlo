    var text = '\n"I HAVE A DREAM" -- Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nI am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as\nthe greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we\nstand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous\ndecree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro\nslaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It\ncame as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\n\nBut 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years\nlater, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles\nof segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years\nlater, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a\nvast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro\nis still languished in the corners of American society and finds\nhimself an exile in his own land. And so we\'ve come here today to\ndramatize a shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we\'ve come to our nation\'s capital to cash a check. When\nthe architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the\nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a\npromissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note\nwas a promise that all men - yes, black men as well as white men -\nwould be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note\ninsofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring\nthis sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad\ncheck, a check that has come back marked "insufficient funds."\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We\nrefuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great\nvaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we\'ve come to cash this\ncheck, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and\nsecurity of justice. We have also come to his hallowed spot to remind\nAmerica of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the\nluxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of\ngradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of\ndemocracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley\nof segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time\nto lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the\nsolid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality\nfor all of God\'s children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the\nmoment. This sweltering summer of the Negro\'s legitimate discontent\nwill not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and\nequality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those\nwho hoped that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be\ncontent will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business\nas usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until\nthe Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt\nwill continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright\nday of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the\nwarm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process\nof gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful\ndeeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking\nfrom the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our\nstruggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not\nallow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again\nand again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical\nforce with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed\nthe Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white\npeople, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence\nhere today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with\nour destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is\ninextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march\nahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the\ndevotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never\nbe satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable\nhorrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our\nbodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the\nmotels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be\nsatisfied as long as the Negro\'s basic mobility is from a smaller\nghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our\nchildren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by\nsigns stating "for whites only." We cannot be satisfied as long as a\nNegro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he\nhas nothing for which to vote. No, no we are not satisfied and we will\nnot be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and\nrighteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials\nand tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail\ncells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom\nleft you battered by storms of persecution and staggered by the winds\nof police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative\nsuffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is\nredemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina,\ngo back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and\nghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation\ncan and will be changed.\n\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today my\nfriends - so even though we face the difficulties of today and\ntomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the\nAmerican dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the\ntrue meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident,\nthat all men are created equal."\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of\nformer slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit\ndown together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state\nsweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of\noppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a\nnation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by\nthe content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists,\nwith its governor having his lips dripping with the words of\ninterposition and nullification - one day right there in Alabama\nlittle black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with\nlittle white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every\nhill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made\nplain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of\nthe Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South\nwith. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of\ndespair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform\nthe jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of\nbrotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray\ntogether, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up\nfor freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day, this will be the day when all of God\'s children\nwill be able to sing with new meaning "My country \'tis of thee, sweet\nland of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father\'s died, land of\nthe Pilgrim\'s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!"\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so\nlet freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let\nfreedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring\nfrom the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\n\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom\nring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi - from\nevery mountainside.\n\nLet freedom ring. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom\nring - when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from\nevery state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when\nall of God\'s children - black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,\nProtestants and Catholics - will be able to join hands and sing in the\nwords of the old Negro spiritual: "Free at last! Free at last! Thank\nGod Almighty, we are free at last!"\n\n'
