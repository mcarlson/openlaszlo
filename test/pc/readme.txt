This directory contains a number of tests for the persistent connection. I view the below files as a minimal set of tests  to verify the functionality of the persistent connection. 

agent.jsp : Simple jsp agent that responds to PC messages
agentlist.lzx : test to verify agentlist operates correctly
agent.lzx : speaks to agent
authentication.lzx : Test various authenticators
conn_groups.lzx : test for connection groups. 
data.lzx : use of data calls for working with PC send / receive datasets 
events.lzx : test of all connection events triggered correctly
messages.lzx : testing message content and data structures
secure.lzx : battery of tests that works across https
userlist.lzx : verify userlist functionality working

Need to get more detail in here and get it in line with what pablo has written
