LPP-8986 (Overriding final static method generates compiler warning)

Expected:
The compiler shouldn't warn for overriding final methods which are allocated on
the class. Explanation from ptw:
<classA> and <classB> are both instances of the <class> (meta)class, so their
class-allocated properties do not intersect. `extends` pertains only to their
instance-allocated properties.

This test case won't work eventually in later releases, see LPP-8993.
