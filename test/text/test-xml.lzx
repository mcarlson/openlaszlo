This is some multiline text with &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; chars.<br/>It has a linebreak before this line.<br/>And also before this one.<br/>
   This line of  text         should be normalized.
<pre>

  But this paragraph is
  preformatted so that
  linebreaks occurs at 
  the ends of lines with newlines.
  And    we    do   not  normalize   text   here.

Double line break before that.
</pre>
<p>   Now we are     back             to normalized           text.</p>This is the last line.    </text>
