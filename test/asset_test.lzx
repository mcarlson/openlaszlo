    bug 416 - 

    We're running into some strange effects when integrating .swf assets 
    into our Laszlo application that are causing us quite a few production 
    headaches.  I've attached a simple example and am hoping you have some 
    insight or workaround.
 
    First, if you open the two .swf assets directly in Flash, you'll see 
    that both have been produced with a light cream-colored background.  When 
    both of these are brought onto the same canvas in asset_test.lzx, 
    our application (remember we're still using P3+) renders 
    print_options_sheen_btn.swf as having a bright yellow background.  
    Further, if you switch the order in which the two views are defined in 
    the .lzx, the sheen button looks correct now -
    but startoverbtn.swf has a dark, discolored background.  
    
    I believe both .swf files were produced directly in Flash (not 
    Illustrator).  In other assets, different strange effects occur -
    usually involving shading and background colors appearing as solid black, 
    red, or other colors.

    This testcase has some additional use now that the original
     bug has been repaired. There are some multiframe resources and 
     single frame resources in the view. We should use this to include
     more swf resources as we get odd situations.
