[JAVARPC]

To run these, you need to do "ant build-tests" first. The java sources are
located in WEB-INF/lps/server/src/org/openlaszlo/test/xmlrpc.

- test-all.lzx: lzunit test. Runs test-count.lzx, test-databinding.lzx,
and test-typemap.lzx.

- innerclass.lzx: inspect debugger output, make sure there are no exceptions

- serverenv.lzx: gets server system properties.

- session-counter.lzx: invokes counter class in server which can be saved in
either session or webapp object.

- session.lzx: tests <sessionrpc>.

- webapp.lzx: tests <webapprpc>.



[SOAP]

- amazon.lzx: tests amazon SOAP webservice.

- context.lzx: tests <remotecalls remotecontext="...">.

- dictionary.lzx: tests document style SOAP service.

- geography.lzx: tests RPC call with array return value.

- google.lzx: tests declared <param> style in <remotecall>. Return value is a
  complex object.

- temperature.lzx: tests scalar return value.




[XMLRPC]

- meerkat.lzx: a crude example of a hierarchical navigation system, driven by
  data obtained from O'Reilly news syndication service (Meerkat) that uses
  XMLRPC as the protocol. Pretty straightforward to use; the top level is news
  categories, which contain channels, which in turn are collections of articles.

- serverenv.lzx: a simple example of querying a standalone Java XMLRPC service
  to display server environment in a list. Click on list items to see their
  values.

  You'll need to run serverenv.sh. Make sure you LPS_HOME and JAVA_HOME
  environment variables are correctly set and nothing is running in port 8181.
