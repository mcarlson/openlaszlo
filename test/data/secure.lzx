  <!-- Tests whether you can open a secure HTTPS connection for data to the LPS server,
  which then opens an insecure proxied HTTP connection to the data back end. That is the 
  desired behavior.

  What you should see happen is an HTTPS connection from the browser
  to the LPS, and then an HTTP request issued from the server to the
  target backend data source
  http://www.beartronics.com:8800/test/foo.xml.

  The ondata event should then fire and a small XML string be printed to the debugger.

  If the test file http://www.beartronics.com:8800/test/foo.xml is not
  available, replace this with a URL to some xml data page with a
  small XML test data.
