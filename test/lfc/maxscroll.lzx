        1 Apple set new records for itself with revenue of<br/>
        2 $10.17 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.61 billion, or $1.78 per <br/>
        3 diluted share. All figures are up from the same period last year’s $9.6 <br/>
        4 billion revenue, net quarterly profit of $1.58 billion, or $1.76 per diluted<br/> 
        5 share. Gross margin remained the same at 34.7 percent.<br/>
        6 <br/>
        7 The company is optimistic that it will stay profitable in the upcoming quarter. <br/>
        8 “Our outstanding results generated over $3.6 billion in cash during the quarter,” <br/>
        9 said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter <br/>
        10 of 2009, we expect revenue in the range of about $7.6 billion to $8 billion and <br/>
        11 we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $.90 to $1.00.”<br/>
        12<br/>
        13 It’s no coincidence that we’ve been seeing more Apple products in people’s hands <br/>
        14 during their commute, or more MacBooks in coffee shops. Apple said that it sold <br/>
        15 2,524,000 Macs computers during the quarter, representing nine percent unit <br/>
        16 growth over the year-ago quarter. 71 percent of those Macs were notebooks, <br/>
        17 partially thanks to the introduction of the newly designed unibody MacBooks.<br/>
        18 <br/>
        19 Apple also sold more iPods than it ever before with 22,727,000 during the <br/>
        20 quarter, representing three percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. <br/>
        21 Quarterly iPhone units sold were 4,363,000, representing 88 percent unit <br/>
        22 growth over the year-ago quarter (but down from the previous quarter).<br/>
        23 <br/>
        24 “Even in these economically challenging times, we are incredibly pleased to <br/>
        25 report our best quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple history--surpassing $10<br/> 
        26 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever,” said Steve Jobs, <br/>
        27 Apple’s CEO.<br/>
        28 <br/>
        29 Do you credit Apple's recent success to Steve Jobs? Or do you believe that<br/> 
        30 Jobs' role in Apple is over perceived and the products that the company dishes <br/>
        31 out should be credited to others like Ive?<br/>
        32 THIS IS THE LAST LINE!
