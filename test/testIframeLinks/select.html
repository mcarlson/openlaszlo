        This is some text which I would like to select. <p>
        But it is in an iframe, and <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-8303">LPP-8303</a> is a bug which stops it from being selectable in Safari (but not Firefox).
        <p>
          
 <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-8306">LPP-8306</a> Is a bug where clicking on a link in the html frame
does nothing. It was broken in Safari AND in IE7, but should now be fixed, and you should be able to drag-select text
here, and to click on a link and load the linked page into the iframe.
