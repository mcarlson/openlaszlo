<!-- This test case demonstrates that loading a library can break the "instanceof"
mechanism. Initially, slist is an instance of basecomponent, because it's a basevaluecomponent,
which is defined as a direct subclass of basecomponent. You can see this by mousing over the
button, which prints out the value of "slist instanceof basecomponent". Click the button -
this loads the library "baseformitem.lzx" dynamically (which, incidentally, statically includes
basevaluecomponent.lzx, which we already statically included here). Mouse over the button 
again - you will see that slist is no longer an instance of basecomponent. -->
