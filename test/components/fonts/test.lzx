            Frosty the Snowman, was a jolly happy soul,
            With a corncob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal.
            Frosty the Snowman, is a fairytale, they say.
            He was made of snow, but the children know he came to life one day.
            There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
            For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around!
