# Installed Flex 4.1 Update 	 4.1.0.16076 	 Thu June 30, 2010 

# http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/trunk
#
# If a pre-built release from adobe is being used, skip the step where 
# you do "svn export" and "ant", below, and just copy the files as specified.
#
# The approach I take below is to copy chunks of the Flex tree, and then
# prune away the files we don't need, such as source to components, etc.
#
================================================================

# Build from source, (assumes adobe flex tree is at ~/openlaszlo/adobe/trunk,
# and we build a staging area for the flex tree in /tmp/flex)

# We need to get files without taking the .svn files. So first do an
# export from the adobe svn tree, to get a tree which has no .svn info
# in it

svn export trunk /tmp/flex


# do "ant" in the flex dir to build the compiler and various libs
cd /tmp/flex; ant

# NOTE: [2009-07-30] we decided to not use the copies of the batik
# .jars from the Flex SDK, and just use some selected batik jar files
# direct from the apache release. So don't copy over any of batik jar files
# NOTE: We also don't copy the  XML parser .jars, they cause doc
# build to fail.  flex seems happy without them, maybe only needed for
# compiling MXML?  

# skip saxon9.jar, because it conflicts with the js2doc tools
