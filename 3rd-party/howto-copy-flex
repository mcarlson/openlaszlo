# assumes adobe flex tree is at ~/openlaszlo/adobe/trunk



# Need to copy without taking the svn files. First do an export from 
# the adobe svn tree, to get a tree which has no .svn info in it

svn export trunk /tmp/flex

# NOTE: [2009-07-30] we decided to not use the copies of the batik
# .jars from the Flex SDK, and just use some selected batik jar files
# direct from the apache release. So don't copy over any of batik jar files
# NOTE: We also don't copy the  XML parser .jars, they cause doc
# build to fail.  flex seems happy without them, maybe only needed for
# compiling MXML?
